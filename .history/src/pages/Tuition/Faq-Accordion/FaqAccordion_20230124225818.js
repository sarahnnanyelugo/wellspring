              Knowing a schoolâ€™s fees is just as important as knowing the
              tuition. While most schools charge additional fees for educational
              resources, such as books and technology, The First Academy does
              not. These expenses are already included in tuition, and our fees
              are approximately half of the cost charged by other Central
              Florida private schools.
