              A Prayer for Oneness in the wake of the death of George Floyd
            </h6>
            <p>Steve D. Whitaker, Ph.D. (Head of School)</p>
            <p>June 3, 2020</p>
            <p>
              On behalf of Wellspring College, I join our sponsoring church
              First Orlando in praying for those who grieve, repenting for our
              transgressions, and asking for divine healing in the midst of our
              brokenness (2 Chronicles 7:14). “Today, we want to say boldly and
              clearly that we stand against and object to all forms of racism,
              bigotry, hate and abuse. Like Jesus, we desire to align with and
              identity with, and love the marginalized, mistreated and abused.
              We grieve over the recent death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and
              call for abuses like these to be addressed with speed and justice.
              We understand that in the hearts of our fellow citizens of color
              incidents like these connect to a long history of abuse and
              unequal justice in our country. We thank God for our law
              enforcement officers that bravely risk their lives for the sake of
              others and uphold justice with dignity and integrity, we also
              lament when some law enforcement officers misuse their authority
              and bring unnecessary harm on the people they are called to
              protect. We pray for our local, state, and national leaders as
              they seek justice, and call on them to act quickly and diligently
              to ensure that these situations are brought to an end.” – Danny de
              Armas, Senior Associate Pastor First Orlando The message of the
              Gospel is clear. We must love others and serve others the way
              Jesus did (John 15:13). We must do justly, love mercy, and walk
              humbly (Micah 6:8). Today we ask in faith, believing that our
              Heavenly Father will bring beauty from ashes and hope from despair
              (Isaiah 61:3). May His church be a light in the darkness pointing
              to the One who brings rest and peace and the promise of eternal
              life through Jesus Christ our Lord (John 3:16).

            <p>
              In order to strengthen our school community, The First Academy
              secured feedback from parents, students, faculty, school
              leadership, and the School Board by hosting a series of strategic
              planning sessions with six “Diversity Teams.” The following action
              steps were adopted as a result of their work:
            </p>

              <li>
                Wellspring College will state that racial language and/or
                actions that are insensitive, hostile, offensive, or

                lowest level of discipline, but could escalate to out-of-school
                suspension or expulsion: Action Step Completed
              </li>
              <li>

                a subsequent racial incident, the discipline administered will
