              Left to our own power none of us loves, honors, or respects God or
              others as we should. Economic, cultural, and racial differences
              often become showcases for the ugliness of sin. However, the
              Gospel shows us a better way. It calls out and kills this sin and
              in its place raises up and empowers a new kind of life which
              delights in God and willingly sacrifices for the good of others.
              The Gospel allows us to see our economic, cultural, and racial
              differences not as reasons to divide but as opportunities to
              celebrate the goodness and grace of our God.

              and girl in His image, which is to say that in our humanity we all
              bear the marks of our maker. He has uniquely designed humanity so
